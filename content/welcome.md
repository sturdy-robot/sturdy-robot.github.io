Hello, world!

This is my first personal website, where I'm posting more about my stuff here. If you don't know me,
check my projects out on [GitHub](https://github.com/sturdy-robot), where I've been doing some software
development lately.

I'm a 26-year old, recently graduated computer scientist from Brazil. I work at IBM as a technical writer,
and recently I've been working on some game development projects with Python and software development with Rust.

Some of my projects are dealing with sports simulation stuff, and I'm learning about emulator development as well, so I may bring some news here.

This page is just somewhere that I'd like to post about things that I learn along the way, and ideas that
I want to share. Might be a good place to post some tutorials later on as well. We'll see.

Thank you for coming by.

See ya anytime soon.
